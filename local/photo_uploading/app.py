# what we want to do: feed images into a function to convert them to photogrammerty 3d model, and store it in a website.
# course of action :
# user log in/out website, code something that reads all images from a directory, zips them and uploads to server. 
#i actually think bash would be easier for this lol. we can still use python for automation.
# this file should control the cameras and save the images to a directory, photos 
#next it should call the bash script to zip and upload the images to the server.
# it will be running hand in hand with the local website to control the cameras and upload the images.
