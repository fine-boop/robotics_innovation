# Our FLL 2026 Innovation Project

## The Idea

The idea is to create a box in which archaeologists can put smaller artefacts and have them automatically categorised, weighted and 3D scanned.  
For the 3D scanning, we will be using a single camera and capturing the artefact from all angles.  
The photos will be sent to a more capable server which will use a third-party software to convert those images into a single 3D model.  
This will then be sent back to the Pi.

## Roles and To-Do

So, there’s a lot of work to be done.  
We’re gonna need a person to figure out the photogrammetry software,  
a person to work with databases (user auth + categorizing artefacts),  
and a person to design the frontend.
